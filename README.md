# Homeworld Remastered Toolkit for Blender
Blender add-on for creating content for Homeworld: Remastered.

Contains a custom Collada export script that exports and imports DAE files compatible with the HODOR tools. Also contains automated creation tools for ship hardpoints, nav lights, background lights and LOD nodes. 

Contains an early version of a HWRM level file importer, which I intend to develop further.

Also contains a DAE importer for importing Homeworld Remastered DAE files (backgrounds, ships and subsystems).

The authors claim no copyright to this version.

Joint Tools contributed by Dominic Cassidy (drache9335@gmail.com).

Forked by Dom2 to merge with the importer and add the background tools.
